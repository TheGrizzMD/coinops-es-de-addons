# coinops-es-de-addons (Addons for the CoinOPS ES-DE theme)
- This repository contains arcade cabinet images for the coinop-es-de theme for EmulationStation Desktop Edition.
- The images are for a personal set curated MAME roms, and I am just uploading them to this repository in case anyone else wants to use them.  I plan to upload the rest of the artwork I use as well at some point.

## **Installation**
1. Place the imageOverrides folder in the ***coinops-es-de*** directory
    - For SteamOS on Steam deck this path will likely be: ```/home/deck/.emulationstation/themes/coinops-es-de```
    - For Windows Portable the path is: ```PathToES-DE"\.emulationstation\themes\coinops-es-de***```

## **Acknowledgments**
These images were originally created by gjsmsmith for CoinOPS Next 2
