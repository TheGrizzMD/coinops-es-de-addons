# coinops-es-de-addons (Addons for the CoinOPS ES-DE theme)
- This repository contains arcade cabinet images for the coinop-es-de theme for EmulationStation Desktop Edition.
- The images are for a curated MAME rom set of 694 games, and I am just uploading them to this repository in case anyone else wants to use them.
- The set uses USA region roms where available.  The files can be renamed as needed for different parent/clone roms as desired

## **Installation**
1. Place the imageOverrides folder in the ***coinops-es-de*** directory
    - For SteamOS on Steam deck this path will likely be: ```/home/deck/.emulationstation/themes/coinops-es-de```
    - For Windows Portable the path is: ```"PathToES-DE"\.emulationstation\themes\coinops-es-de```

## **Other Artwork**
- Artwork for the standard media types supported by ES-DE can be scraped as normal from within ES-DE
- I will provide links to my own curated artwork at some point if anyone else wants to use them.  They include translated logos for Japanese games, and fan art based on box art that screenscraper currently doesn't accept.

These images were originally created by gjsmsmith for CoinOPS Next 2
