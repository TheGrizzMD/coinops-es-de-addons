# coinops-es-de-addons (Addons for the CoinOPS ES-DE theme)
- This repository contains arcade cabinet images for the coinop-es-de theme for EmulationStation Desktop Edition.
- These images are for a curated MAME rom set of 694 games, and I have made them available here in case anyone else wants to use them.
- The set uses USA region roms where available.  The files can be renamed as needed for different parent/clone roms.

    - For SteamOS on Steam Deck this path will likely be: ```/home/deck/.emulationstation/themes/coinops-es-de```
    - For Windows Portable the path is: ```"PathToES-DE"\.emulationstation\themes\coinops-es-de```

## **Other Artwork**
- I sometimes submit artwork to screenscraper.fr as well, however they do not accept all of my submissions for whatever reason.  Because of this I have made matching artwork sets available below:
- A matching set of fan art images is available here:
